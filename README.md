Remote Sound

An application focusing on letting users choose their sound file (.WAV) and playing through the output channels of their choice. This can be tested without having the physical cables by using a virtual audio cable, for instance. An example of this would be to transmit sounds, songs, effects over the microphone to be heard on voice communication programs such as Skype, Teamspeak, Ventrilo, etc.

It is still rather hardcoded (as it is an old project) however feel free to tinker it however you'd like. I'll update this from time to time depending on needs and will give more instructions once it is "user friendly".
